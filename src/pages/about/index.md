### Reviving a Laundromat

Owning a laundromat wasn't really on Matthew Dusing's radar when he left his job in 2015. He was seeking to restore and flip houses. He was prodded to check out the closed-down business by his Pastor. When he did, he found a prospective opportunity that filled a need that the village of Mount Morris had for some time. After some blood, sweat and tears for the next several months, The Mat was revived Mid-January 2016. 

Mount Morris was without a Laundromat for two years. It now has a thriving one, well-cared for, and open 24-7 365 days a year.
