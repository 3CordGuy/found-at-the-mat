A Shocking Green Bean Casserole from somewhere else. That's what we are gonna make today.

## A Recipe for Success

Today's Find has me making a wonderful fiesta of flavors. It's gonna be a party in your mouth after you finish tasting this crazy concoction.

#### Ingredients

* Ocean Spray Cranberry Sauce
* Cut Green Beans
* 4 Cups of Old Fashioned Caramel Dip
* 1 Jar of Green Olives

#### Steps

1. Remove Green Beans from can and mix thoroughly with cranberry sauce until bowl is full of brownish mush.
2. Add brownish mush to a plate and microwave on high for 4 minutes until mush has gotten a little darker. (Note: Power capacity varies on microwaves so please adjust your time as necessary)
3. Remove from microwave.
4. Take the 4 cups of Old Fashioned Caramel Dip and open the cups. Throw away the plastic dishes with the Caramel. We won't be needing those. Just the lids.
5. Take the foil lids and wad them up into balls and throw them on top of your newly fashioned mud pie.
6. Place back into microwave. Resume cooking on high and enjoy the sparks (NOTE: We are not responsible for damage to your microwave).
7. Remove from microwave when you are getting bored of the sparks.
8. Season with Green Olives (to taste)

Enjoy!
